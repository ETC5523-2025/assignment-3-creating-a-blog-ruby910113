This site collects my work in **data analysis and visualization**. Beyond coursework, Iâ€™ll keep adding personal projects, learning notes, and experimental ideas, turning data into clear stories with an emphasis on **reproducibility** and **versioned workflows**.

Youâ€™ll find:  
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization and communication  
- Spatial and time-series analyses across domains
