Hi, my name is Ting-Ting Wu, but you can also call me Ruby (I actually prefer Ruby).

I’m Taiwanese and did my undergraduate studies in Taiwan. After finishing my studies in Auckland in 2023 and 2024, I came to Australia in 2025 to continue my education.

My interests include hiking, traveling, and watching anime. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to hang out or go on an adventure together!!!
