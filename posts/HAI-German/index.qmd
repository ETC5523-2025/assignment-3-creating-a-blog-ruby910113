  Germany shows **lower hospital HAI prevalence** than the EU/EEA average but paradoxically a **higher burden per population**. This post answers three questions: 
  
  - *How large* is the burden (cases, deaths, DALYs)?  
  - *Which HAI types* drive it?  
  - *What actions* follow for prevention?

## Data description

- **The analysis** draws on estimates produced with the **Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections (BHAI)** workflow.
- **Data sources:** the **2011** German **point-prevalence survey (PPS)** and the **2011-2012** EU/EEA PPS.
- **Download:** data and supplementary materials are available from [Eurosurveillance](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.46.1900135#supplementary_data).
- **HAI types included:**  
  - **HAP** - healthcare-associated pneumonia  
  - **BSI** - primary bloodstream infection  
  - **UTI** - urinary tract infection  
  - **SSI** - surgical-site infection  
  - **CDI** - *Clostridioides difficile* infection
  
- **Reporting format:** annual estimates; some results shown **per 100,000 people**; values are **medians** with **95% uncertainty intervals**.

- **How numbers are produced (see @fig-workflow):**  
  1. **Prevalence in hospital** from PPS
  2. Convert to **hospital incidence** via a modified **Rhame-Sudderth** formula using **length of infection (LOI)**  
  3. **Scale to population** using national **hospital discharges** and **population size**  
  4. **Stratify by age/sex** using the PPS distribution  
  5. **Adjust for comorbidity** (McCabe classes) and estimate **YLL**, **YLD**, and **DALYs**.
